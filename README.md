# WheelOfFortune
This app was created to develop my skills

The main focus of development was on TDD.
First I drew a design with all the functions. Next, I wrote all the use cases for mvp. Based on them, I described all the methods of 2 viewmodels, 2 interactors and a datasource.
If I have all the methods described, it means I can write tests for code that doesn’t exist (that’s what I did, you can see from the commit history). After which I wrote all the logic so that it would pass the tests.

It was important for me to practice creating an MVVM architecture, dividing the app into layers, and working with room. 
Design was in the background. The wheel was made using the library "com.github.alirezaafkar:LuckyWheel_Android:0.5.0".
The application has 38 unit tests for all layers of the architecture.
There are 2091 lines of code written in total.
